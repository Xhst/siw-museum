section.about.text = The Borghese Gallery Museum houses and exhibits a collection of ancient sculptures, bas-reliefs, and mosaics, as well as paintings and sculptures from the 15th to the 19th century. Among the masterpieces of the collection, whose first and most important nucleus dates back to the collecting activity of Cardinal Scipione (1579-1633), nephew of Pope Paul V, there are works by <b>Caravaggio, Raphael, Titian, Correggio, Antonello da Messina, Giovanni Bellini, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, and Canova's sculptures</b>.<br><br>The works are displayed in the <b>20 frescoed rooms</b> which, together with the porch and the entrance hall, constitute the Museum's public spaces. Over 260 paintings are stored in the Deposits of the Borghese Gallery, located above the Pinacoteca's level and arranged like a painting gallery. The Deposits of the Borghese Gallery can be visited by appointment.<br><br>For safety reasons related to the historical building's structure, access to the Museum is regulated in two-hour visiting shifts, for a maximum of 360 people each, with mandatory exit at the end of the shift.
